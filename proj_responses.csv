Last week I had a few panic attacks in anticipation of telling my parents something important that I knew they wouldn’t be happy with. On Friday I decided to let my mom know and she responded with anger and brief conversation before hanging up. Ever since they’ve been avoiding me ever since and also my brother hasn’t been as supportive as I hoped. Additionally I have a lot of projects with deadlines. Overall I feel anxious and just want the next month to pass. I hate the feeling of drowning in work. everything is due in the next couple weeks so I’m trying to get it done on top of my job.   Today I tried to reach out to my mom and now she wants to talk, but it makes me anxious. Also today I’m having my first performance review ever and I’m pretty nervous. Overall just a anxiety filled week. While I do feel anxious I also feel pretty determined to stand my ground and get everything done. I feel like I can do it, but it sucks that my anxiety gets in the way. I also feel really tired and want to work on lessening my load. ","I felt angry recently. I feel frustrated at my family for not being accepting. Typically I just tell someone when I’m angry and then tell myself it’s ok to be angry. Later I just cool down and let it go. I can’t really control other peoples reactions but I can control my own. When I do get angry especially at my family it can be scary for me because all my past resentment will come back up and it’s hard for me not to be really negative. It feels like a black hole or slippery slope lol. The specific moment where I got angry was when my brother started defending my parents, so I texted him a long paragraph countering all his points. I then called my friends and began to show them why I was annoyed with my brother and they backed me up. Typically I get less angry and more analytical when I start talking it out and feel supportive. I think usually my anxiety of confrontation is stronger than my anger, so even though I still feel angry I feel more anxious rn and just want everything to go back to normal.",204,195

That’s super stressful for me because I haven’t presented in a long time and I’m very afraid I’m gonna mess it up or he’s gonna be mad at me, so I have to practice that. So I was locked in yesterday for 12 hours at the PCL just grinding out work. Also I’m getting so lost in a lot of my classes like stuff is going right over my head and I have no idea what to do about it other than to grind through like how am I supposed to get a good grade on tests if I can’t even pay attention in class. At least I attend I know so many people that don’t even attend class. Other than that no significant events. I had dinner on Saturday with m friends and that was really fun, and I’ve been having girl problems but that’s about it and I’d rather not think about that.","About 2 weeks ago this girl that I had a past with told me she actually did have feelings for me. Context, early December she went through a break up around new years we kind got together and I really liked her but she said “I can’t do this”, and she basically told me to get over me and for the next two months I kinda felt like she was stringing me along. As I was finally getting over her and we were trying to be friends she drunk calls me and says she actually has liked me for a while. But she didn’t actually say that all she said was I’m confused about my feelings for “some people”. Because god forbid she communicates clearly. And so I had to dig through her words until she would finally admit it. And it’s like if your confused why would you tell me? I don’t want to know that we’re supposed to be friends. And if you liked me why would you say that your confused just tell me you like me. It just really pissed me off.",191,186

My weekend was pretty fun as I went out of town with one of my student organization’s and I was able to interact with a lot of CS students. I loved getting to know new people as well as seeing their perspectives on tech. Since it was a hackathon, I also had the privilege of seeing the applications and websites that the students were building! Very inspiring to start coding as a hobby. Although this week itself hasn’t been too crazy, I will be celebrating a 13 month anniversary with my partner. I am feeling very grateful to have them in my love, as well as just feeling very lovey and happy to have completed 13 months!! It is going to be a busier couple of weeks for me as midterms ramp up and I have exams coming up, but I am glad to at least be able to celebrate something sweet with my partner despite the upcoming stress.","One time I recently experienced anger may have been earlier today in one of my classes. Today, we were discussing the business aspect of jewelry companies that source their own raw materials (meaning they are in charge of their mining facilities). Specifically, the company we were discussing had their mining facilities in South Africa and they were complicit in a lot of the exploitation and modern day apartheid slavery in South Africa. Although the company later experienced radical change under a new CEO, a lot of my peers had very “interesting” takes on the position of the company. It was very enraging to say the least as these issues deal with real people. As well as the recent attention in exploitation of people in places like in Congo. It was disappointing to see how little my classmates were able to tie the themes of this company to real world issues. ",167,150

I slogged through my lab shift Monday but made it through (yay!) before running some errands and then going on a walk with my friend and his dog, which was super nice. That evening I went to weightlifting and had a really great training session, and finished up some exam grading, which actually wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. The next day was a little tiring because I had a lot of classes in a row, but all of them were mildly interesting and I was at least happy to be there. I gave a presentation in my honors class, and it was really well received, people asked great questions and seemed to like my experiment #yay","A time I recently felt anger has to do with my Honors Thesis experiment in the lab. Our original time when we were going to run my rats depended on an experiment finishing in time, and that experiment is not done. I was frustrated because I feel like no one in the lab vouched for me, and I needed to speak up for myself to run my experiment earlier or during winter break or something. Our only option now is to run them at the end of the day, which makes everyone's life super difficult since there will be so many rats running and mine will run super late. I'll have to change up my schedule to accommodate the running time for my rats, and I'll have very little help from other people at the end of the day, which is really really frustrating. I just feel like I'm running uphill to get this experiment done and no one cares about it except me.  ",156,164

I spent a lot of time being productive, getting work done, and taking tests, which made me feel very relieved at the end of the week. I felt that I could take some time to relax and did so by being around my friends. I felt as if I became closer to my friends/former acquaintances, which is extremely fulfilling for me. At the same time, I spent a lot of time with friends during the week when I could have been more focused, and I feel guilty and frustrated about that. A lot of my self-worth is based on my determination and ability to work hard, so not putting my best into my work last week took away from my perception of myself. Overall, this week was positive, both personally and professionally. I think I often try to strike a balance between the two aspects of my life and try to redirect myself when I stray from that balance. This week has enabled me to redirect myself, and I think I am better off because of it.","Most recently, I have felt anger due to my personal relationships. Often, I tend to overanalyze my interactions with people and take note of their actions, words, and various cues that may indicate certain things. Recently, people around me have seemed distant, and I have formed the idea that it is because they don't see me as important to their lives. My circle tends to be quite small, and I put in the time to ensure those connections are strong. However, I feel as if the people on the other end don't feel the need to put in that same effort. Eventually, I end up thinking that the other person is actively trying to separate themselves from me. While that is something I can live with, I feel as if they try to break my connections with others too. As someone with a small circle, that is extremely damaging, and I can't help but feel anger at those friends for doing that. But, in the end, I'll never know what the truth is, so I'll have to let the anger go at some point.",182,184
2/27/2024 15:02:31,Female,19,Queer/ LGBTQIA+,White,Liberal Arts,Government,Junior,"So far my week has had both highs and lows. My parents came into town because my brother was competing in UIL state swimming, and seeing them was the highlight of my weekend. On the other hand, my mom brought some bad news about my grandma. She's been dealing with liver/colon cancer for a while now, but she had just done a trial for a new treatment. The trial was horrible, she apparently said that she ""now knows what hell is like."" On top of that, the treatment isn't even guaranteed to bring positive results, and she'd be homebound for a while after it. My grandma is someone who walks for hours a day just because she enjoys it, so being homebound is something that might tank her mental health. I spent a lot of the weekend crying for her; I just wish I could take her place.","I feel resentful and angry at life. This peaked a few weeks ago when I found out that my cousin's cancer had come back, this time in his bone marrow and brain fluid. He spent a significant amount of time going through chemo to get rid of his leukemia, and we'd just visited him in the Netherlands. It felt like having the rug ripped out from under you only to find out there's no floor supporting you. I feel angry that both my grandma and cousin are struggling with this horrible disease. I don't believe in any god, but if they exist I feel especially resentful towards them. I feel so helpless being an ocean away, not even able to give them a hug or talk to them in person. The helplessness turns into self-resentment sometimes, with me criticizing myself for not doing enough or not being able to do anything of value for them.",148,155

I only slept 2 hours last night but worth it because I’m able to relax a bit when attending events that I need to be at and want to enjoy! NSC has some events this week so I’m excited to be able to attend them but I feel like there’s too much (more than I expected) to do this week. Yeah, not much happened thus far but im excited ad stressed for what is to come! This changes the question asked but this weekend that passed I celebrated a friend’s birthday by going camping and although I felt a lot of academic guilt on the trip I think the mind reset was much needed to get through this week.",The other day my very close friend came up to me and COUGHED in my face and they thought it was funny…. Like???? I’m confused as to why you thinking spreading spit and pathogens is funny but go off ig? LOL to be very honest this isnt the first time as well. The first (and maybe second…) time i j laughed it off because my reactions to them coughing were very intense but this was out of the blue while i was packing my bag??? Genuinely so outta pocket lol. I tried to keep composure and just pretended to throw something away. I felt honestly disrespected and genuinely baffled as to why they do this.,129,115

Was definitely rejuvenating and helped with feeling stressed. Started therapy for the very first time 2 days ago, attending my next session tomorrow. It definitely made me open up and get out a lot of personal things I've had buried and hadn't realized I hadn't gotten over. I did cry, which I expected, but I didn't think I would to that extent. Felt a little awkward but it was ok, the therapist was pretty cool and nice. I'm just hoping I can fix my issues as soon as possible and get out what needs to get out. I just want a little bit of time where I don't have this weight of my future on my shoulders. Just want a little bit of time where I can go to bed without a million things I still have left to fix for my future. ","Got more and more angry the more I realized someone who calls me one of their best friends in college has definitely talked about me behind my back. She's always got the worst things to say about everyone, and can't keep any of her other really good friends' secrets to herself. I've known for a while I need to put up boundaries with her, and I have, but recently I've been realizing how she's probably said things about my friends from home. It's crossing a line for me, and it makes me so angry how people say whatever they want and judge people without even knowing them or what is going on in their personal lives. People without perspective who are always negative and speak without putting themselves in others' shoes makes me so angry. It's irritating, frustrating, annoying, and it makes you look like an idiot no matter how smart you consider yourself to be in school.",166,158

I skipped classes for a whole day mainly to catch up on work but also because I was feeling lazy. One of the better parts of my week was going to see a movie with my friend! I bought this subscription to this movie theater where I can see as many new movies as I want and it’s only like $25 a month. I’m excited to take advantage of that. My friend bought the subscription too so hopefully we can see movies together. I’ve also been buying food out a lot which is both a positive and negative thing because I love getting food out but it is not good for me to keep spending money when I have food at home. I accidentally left my headphones at my friend’s apartment over the weekend and for some reason that also stressed me out because I’m always wearing those headphones. All good now because I got them back.","Recently I was pretty angry about a situation with an assignment in a class I’m taking. Basically the assignment asked me to write down observations and connect them with what we were learning in the class, which I thought was easy enough, and I thought I had done a pretty thorough job. But then my prof sent back the assignment to me and said I needed to give specific examples of our learnings in class. I had literally quoted our readings!! I was so confused. I think a lot of students made this mistake because the next day she gave us a small lesson on “reading a rubric”… I was like ok maybe you just need to be making better rubrics because I read the rubric and watched the video she put explaining the assignment and would have never known exactly how she wanted us to reference what we’ve learned. Like she didn’t show us an examples until we had already turned it in. Very annoying.",183,166

That was our first trip together and it was tiring but nice. I had a mix feeling about this trip since we might start doing long distance soon, and right now there’s so many variables that the long distance situation might last indefinitely. Another significant event would be my first time making cookies and cream ice cream. I’ve been obsessed with Van Leeuwen’s cookies and cream ice cream but it’s so hard to find. The recipe I tried this time is very simple, it only got three ingredients and the process was very straightforward. I am very excited about the final result and I always feel proud when I make  food we buy all the time from scratch.","I normally feel anger when I don’t sleep well. I’d be recalling memories that include unpleasant encounters with someone and imagining that similar situations are going to happen soon in real life, instead this time I’d be handling the situation differently. But other than that I don’t feel anger at all basically, even when I got shit talked in games I’d just be mildly annoyed. Usually this kind of imagination induced anger last very short, the imagination will usually reach a rational conclusion where I handle the situation thoughtfully instead of aggressively, and my anger would end.",133,97

Perhaps the highlight of the past two weeks has been a spontaneous two hour discussion with my philosophy professor during his office hours. We debated about the origins of the universe and on determinism and free will. I remember feeling happy that the conversation was productive in helping me explore the responses to my own philosophical ideas but also because I felt that I had gotten a lot closer to my professor. I had a philosophy lecture today, and I definitely was looking forward to it more relative to previous weeks.","I rarely feel angry about things. In fact, if I were to think back to the last time I genuinely felt anger, I would have to talk about something that happened in high school. Perhaps it isn’t considered recent, but I will talk about it anyways. In high school, I joined a residential college program and had the opportunity to conduct research at a plant biology lab. I was pretty passionate about my work in the lab but I never really externalized it to my friends and roommates. One day, a friend of mine began talking condescendingly of my work and how I hadn’t produced tangible results yet. Often, when I get angry, I try to just internalize it and externally shrug it off. This time, I felt genuinely disrespected and ended up yelling at my friend and called him out. Interestingly, he is my best friend now.",102,148

I visited my family friends over the weekend, which was a nice change from campus. I got to unwind a little from the hectic week before and spend some time with their son, who's 8. I don't have any exams this week, so I was able to take some time to catch up on assignments and cook some healthier food for myself for the week. I'm excited for the rest of the week, since nsc has a lot of fun events coming up!","although I wasn't necessarily furious, but more annoyed, a recent time I remember feeling anger was at my roommates.

When I was looking for my groceries to make some food for myself, I unearthed some moldy produce that they hadn't thrown away that exploded in a cloud in my face.

First of all, my girlfriend’s parents are being extremely unreasonable with a certain situation, and the way they talk to her and treat her is really frustrating. I rarely feel truly mad, but sometimes, one of my coworkers really gets on my nerves. His manipulative tone, rude sense of humor, condescending nature, and honestly sheer stupidity at times really drives me insane. Not as much as when he starts making political statements though.

A week ago I had a hard exam that I was worried about but I actually felt like I did well which felt rewarding for my studying. It was the last exam of this round of midterms and I had concerts on Friday and Saturday that felt like a nice reprieve and reward from all the studying I did. The concerts themselves were very fulfilling with amazing artists and great production. It was nice to see some familiar faces from the music scene. It was also nice to meet new amazing people. While the rest of the weekend didn't really feel productive, I've hit my stride again starting this week and have met all of my goals for homework so I can have another exciting week ahead.","I haven't felt angry in a long time. It's not something I feel often. There are a lot of little things that sometimes upset me. But I don't really get angry more irritated or annoyed. And those are feelings that pass quickly and I forget about. I'm probably forgetting something, but the last memorable time I felt angry was over winter break. Even so thinking about it I wasn't actually angry more irritated and disappointed. My two close friends and I made plans with our other two close friends who are hard to coordinate plans with. We texted weeks before about the plan and the date to confirm we were all good. Except a week later my one friend says she is working that day and didn't schedule it off. So she said she would try to get the day off but I don't think she actually tried. What irritated me is I literally only hang out with this specific group of friends like once or twice a year. The year before, we had one amazing day where we spent the day together. We made plans for another day and my one friend lied about being free as they had a planned family vacation for that time that they knew about. It just really bummed me out. I understand they lied because they were worried about getting sick for a job interview, but that's no reason to lie about that.

I also have been having conflict with my two older siblings so that’s been adding onto the stress, but I feel hopeful that this move will help me move forward with my life and bring me more peace. I was very fortunate last week to have my baby sister in town visiting me. It’s hard to live far away from her so I loved getting to spend the one on one time with her, especially during a stressful time in my life.

I have an old car and told him I didn’t want to drive back and forth before my little sister got here, hoping to prevent any of these issues, but with the nail appointment I would have had to drive back and forth 4 different times which wasn’t okay with me.

I panicked so much with the results that I had panic attacks, could not sleep and and slipped into a full on anxiety disorder, which exhausted me so much that I slipped into a depressive state. This compromised my immunity and the past week has been particularly hard as I got hit with a respiratory infection. I have recently joined some creative classes which I really seemed to be enjoying. I was slowly trying to inch out of my anxiety and depressive state and the classes seemed to help a lot.

There came a time when family members and their needs and aspirations started taking precedence over mine. I keep compromising thinking that was in the best interest of the family. The family has since moved on in their lives, and all doing what they want to do. Unfortunately I seemed to have fallen off the wagon and am not sure how to recreate that self fulfilling life for me. I feel dejected and seem to lack the drive to reinvent myself. Much as I do try, I also feel a bit rusty and unsure how to get back on track. All this is making me angry and full of regrets.

I was in an MRI machine for 2 hours performing tasks related to the study and found it extremely interesting. Before the study, i was a little nervous and did not know what to expect. During the study, I was excited but eventually felt tired and sore because I had to stay in one position without moving for two hours. I also needed to use the restroom but had to wait till the study ended so I felt a little uncomfortable doing that.

I needed them to respond for various things, but none of them were responding which made the whole situation a little more frustrating.

I felt like I was being short-balled at work, and after all the hard work I put in, I felt as though I was not getting my due credit. The way I deal with my anger is I first vent, followed by a crying session, and then I convince myself all is well. I followed the same steps in this situation as well.

To me, NSC is a second family I've made here at UT, so I've been feeling a bit down and empty everytime I realize several prominent role models in my life are getting ready to graduate and move on to the other projects.

If I'm frustrated or disappointed in something/someone, my anger generally dissolves into understanding in a few hours. I also tend to avoid tension and confrontation, so I don't experience many measures of anger anyways. However, one instance of anger I've recently experienced is towards my government professor last semester. This professor would make questionable/disrespectful comments about me in class, and I wouldn't be surprised if she intentionally handed me the lowest grades in her class. One of these comments in class involved my professor emphasizing how chemistry was such a frustrating and unnecessary subject before pointing out to the entire class that I was a chemistry major (it didn't help that I was one of the only 2 non-COLA students in the class), and this perspective on chemistry was apparently only made since this professor started a fire in her high school chemistry class. Comments such as these resulted in my classmates side-eyeing me as I past them on Speedway or kept the door open for them on my way out of class. I kept my frustration over this inwards, and things certaibly didn't get better in her class as the semester progressed. I tried to report this professor at the end of the semester, but that only got mixed reviews from different administrative figures who were quite close to this professor. Still, despite all of this, I hope for the best for this professor and her family (especially since she is on a maternity leave), but I hope that she makes better choices in the future and, ideally, teaches grad school instead where she could be surrounded by students similar to her (and so that she doesn't discriminate against anyone).

My nights have stretched longer, pushing me into a routine where I find myself going to bed well past my usual time, which in turn has led to me waking up much later in the day than I'm accustomed to. Despite this apparent upheaval in my daily rhythm, the volume of work I've managed to get through has seen a marked improvement.This boost in productivity might be attributed to the serene quietude and isolation that the late hours afford me. The world slows down, the incessant buzz of day-to-day life fades into the background, and distractions dwindle to a minimum. It's in this tranquility that I find my mind most lucid and focused, capable of diving deeper into my tasks with a concentration that's elusive during the bustling daytime hours. Perhaps it's the stillness of the night that wraps around me like a cocoon, fostering an environment where thoughts flow freely and creativity flourishes.Moreover, the isolation from typical daytime interruptions—be it social obligations, the constant pinging of notifications, or the simple, yet often disruptive, background noise of daily living—allows for a level of undisturbed focus that seems to supercharge my productivity. This unexpected shift in my working hours has led me to ponder the intricate relationship between our environment, our schedules, and how we function optimally. It's a fascinating revelation that, perhaps, our most effective periods of work might not align with traditional hours, but rather with those we carve out for ourselves, finding peace and productivity in the quiet solitude of the night.","In the midst of our team presentation, I found myself grappling with a surge of anger. This emotion was primarily triggered by one team member's domineering attitude.

Felt pretty stressed and annoyed, but we managed to pull it together and submit something we're proud of. Besides that, had a finance exam that was looming over my head like a dark cloud, but when it finally happened, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. On the flip side, I had a chill night with friends on Saturday, which was a much-needed break from the chaos. We just hung out, watched movies, and had some good laughs. It was a reminder that it's not all about work and stress; those moments of relaxation really matter.","As for when did I most recently feel angry, it has to be with that group project situation which definitely got me there. Feeling let down by a teammate and worrying about how it would affect our grades was infuriating. It's not just about the extra work; it's the feeling of betrayal and having to pick up the pieces when you were already stretched thin. I had to take a few moments to breathe and not let my anger get the best of me. We talked it out as a group (without the ghoster, obviously), focused on what we could control, and moved forward. It was a test of patience and teamwork, but we made it through.",149,117

I had this really demon of a project on fluid mechanics that was basically eating up all my waking hours. There was a moment I thought I'd never see the back of it. 😬 But hey, finally finished it up it late Thursday night, which was a win. Felt like I'd conquered Everest or something. There's also been a ton of stuff going on with the engineering society—I'm trying to juggle responsibilities there, too. Managed to help organize a workshop which, thankfully, went off without a hitch, and they had free food. That was a solid boost amidst the chaos. I also haven't been sleeping enough.","On the anger front, oh boy, let me tell you about a lab session gone wrong. We're in there, trying to get some precise measurements, and the equipment just... fails. Out of nowhere. And it's not the first time, which makes it even more infuriating. It threw our whole session off track, and we ended up having to stay late to redo the experiment. I was fuming, mostly at the situation but also a bit at our department for not maintaining the gear better. It felt like our time and effort were being disrespected. Had to take a step back, vent a bit to friends, and then focus on getting the work done. Not the first challenge thrown our way and definitely won't be the last, but it was a reminder that sometimes, you've just got to roll with the punches and keep pushing forward.",113,145
4/2/2024 20:06:16,Male,20,Straight,Asian (including South Asian and Southeast Asian),Natural Sciences,Computer Science,Sophomore,"This week has been unreal, to say the least. The highlight? I got the confirmation email from Amazon about my internship, and I've been on cloud nine ever since. It feels like all the late nights leet code, coding challenges, and the endless prep finally paid off. Celebrated the news with a mini pizza party with my roommates, which was awesome. I also have been craving to play ping pong lmao so finally got to do that. But it's not all been partying; I've also been knee-deep in assignments and projects that I got behind on because of interview prep. Balancing the excitement with the workload has been tricky but thrilling.","Getting turned down by a tech startup I was excited about really ticked me off. I had nailed the coding test and felt good about the interviews, so the rejection hit hard. It made me doubt my skills and wonder where I fell short. But instead of dwelling on it, I used that frustration as motivation to double down on my efforts. This setback stung, but it also taught me resilience. It’s all about bouncing back stronger, and landing the Amazon internship later was proof that perseverance pays off. The rejection was also a tough pill to swallow, but it highlighted the reality of the tech industry: not every opportunity will be a perfect fit, and that's okay. It's about learning from each experience, improving, and moving forward with even more determination.",111,132

Leading up to the semi-finals for pickleball intermurals, every day was packed with intense training sessions and strategic team meetings.

Winning the semi-finals was a rush; it validated all the hard work and sacrifices. The satisfaction of acing the project presentation added to the week's triumphs. Despite the physical and mental strain, the accomplishments made every moment of exhaustion worthwhile.","The toughest point where I was feeling a lot of anger came when a crucial teammate sustained an injury during our pickleball practice, jeopardizing our strategy for the semi finals that needed him to be playing. I was angry and frustrated, not at him but at the situation because I felt so helpless. It felt like despite our dedication and hard work, factors beyond our control could still derail our efforts. The initial shock and anger pushed us to rethink our approach, rallying around our teammate. This adversity reminded me of the unpredictability of sports and the importance of adaptability and teamwork. ",92,102

This event is a big deal for musicians like me, as it's an opportunity to perform solo pieces in front of a large audience, including peers, professors, and potentially scouts. Amidst my preparations, I encountered a minor hiccup when one of my violin strings broke during practice. This incident was more than a simple inconvenience; it highlighted the intense pressure I was feeling to perform well. Thankfully, the encouragement from fellow music students and the constructive advice from my mentor helped boost my confidence. The thought of presenting my skills and the progress I've made on such an esteemed platform felt daunting yet thrilling, marking a pivotal moment in my journey as a musician.","There was a specific instance during my practice sessions that really tested me emotionally. While practicing an important piece for the upcoming showcase, one of the strings on my violin suddenly snapped. This wasn't just about the inconvenience of replacing a string; it felt like a metaphor for the delicate state of my preparation. I was overwhelmed with frustration, doubting whether I was truly ready to perform and fearful of potentially embarrassing myself on stage. This wave of anger, however, was short-lived.
