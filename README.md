# PSY-341K-Final-Project

In order to preserve our participant's anonymity, we created a 'fake_data.csv' file. Our code has taken this into account and as long as you download that file, it should run smoothly. Additionally, we used the 'warriner_valence.csv' file from Assignment 1. The code is nested inside the data/a1 folder, which are also necessary to download. 

Our Jupyter Notebook was designed to flow with our report. Therefore, you should be able to run all the cells and the produced code will reflect our report's findings. 

Lastly, we have two notebooks: analysis_with_sample_data.ipynb and real_data_notebook.ipynb. The first notebook is the one that should be ran. The second notebook is to display our code we used for the original dataset. 


Thanks!
